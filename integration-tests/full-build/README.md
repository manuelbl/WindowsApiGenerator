# Full Windows API

This is the skeleton project where an integration tests puts the
generated code for the entire Windows API. The code is then compiled
to validate that all generated code is compilable and consistent with
dependent and depending code.

The code is generated by the
[`FullBuild` class](../../windows-api/code-generator/src/test/java/net/codecrete/windowsapi/special/FullBuild.java).
